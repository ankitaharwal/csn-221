Hi First Of All Thanks For visiting this repository.
## Instruction Encoding for Area minimalization of Instruction ROM.
In the current age of competitiion is has become a neccessity to optimise performance in order to just stay with the front.
This project will aim in improving the Instruction Encoding System / Techniques available out there .
We will focus to list the commonly used Instruction Encoding Formats their advantages , disadvantages , fallbacks 
and we will try to improve them so that the chip space can be reduced.
### Why this project is worth putting your interest.
First as we know mooreâ€™s law is ending,
we can no longer make chips small by doubling number of transistors
on a microchip doubles about every two years. To achieve more smaller
chips we have to find new and innovative solutions.


Also please READ the project proposal for details..
