## Path to the Files
For report files visit /Project-Report-Files OR see the /Project-Report.pdf

For analysis of the source code please visit /SourceCode-Version-7.0 you will find all the files here 

For Results please visit /SourceCode-Version-7.0/data/comparison

To run the program just download /SourceCode-Version-7.0 folder and in data files put your 3 MIPS programs in .txt folders with names "file_1.txt" , "file_2.txt" and "file_3.txt". Open terminal in SourceCode-Version-7.0 folder and run the command ./run.sh ! results will be generated in above mentioned folder.

Hi First Of All Thanks For visiting this repository.
## Instruction Encoding for Area minimalization of Instruction ROM.
In this current age of COMPETITION it has become a neccessity to optimise performance of our systems in order to just stay with the front. Every Year hundreds of companies / products show up in the market and hundreds of them (+ already existing) leave the market.

Our project Aims to provide improvements  in the computer systems .
This project will aim in improving the Instruction Encoding System / Techniques available out there in the market.
We will focus to list the commonly used Instruction Encoding Formats their advantages , disadvantages , fallbacks 
and we will try to improve them so that the chip space can be reduced.
### Why this project is worth putting your interest.
First as we know MOORE'S LAW IS ENDING, 
we can no longer make chips small by doubling number of transistors
on a microchip(that used to double about every two years). To achieve more smaller
chips we have to find new and innovative solutions.

And our project emphasises on one of such innovative approach.


Also please READ the project proposal for details..
